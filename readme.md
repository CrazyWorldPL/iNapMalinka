# Welcome to the iNap Malinka main page!
Here you'll find everything about the project, IT'S STILL UNDER MAINTENANCE! The project **isn't finished yet** and important changes will occur soon.
Consider donating me so I can order all needed parts faster!!

## What's iNap Malinka?
This is one amongst many Pi handhelds, that allow you to not only play games, but also make a very flexible HMI suitable for any application - besides of WiFi and Bluetooth, it also offers NRF24L01 for connectivity. That means, any Arduino or Pi project using NRF24L01 can be steered with this little thing!
Not only that, it's as big as your phone, with only 12mm thickness. Two joysticks, 3.5" screen, powered by Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.

## Why Malinka?
* extremely small size compared to other pi handhelds
* big, colorful LCD as always
* two joysticks allowing to play more modern games
* NRF24L01 radio makes it a perfect remote!
* only 3 external ICs, without any aux microcontroller
* uses parts of Nintendo Switch
## Why NOT?
* if you're a fan of Steam Deck, this device is probably too small for you
* lack of joystick pushbuttons as well as analog triggers
* many tools needed to assembly, including a 3D printer
* intermediate soldering skills are needed
* uses parts of Nintendo Switch
## Specifications
* 3.5" 480x320 ILI9488 screen with capacitive touch controller (but without touch atm)
* Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with possible OC
* 1500mAh lipo battery
* dimensions 154x68x12mm (with case)
* two joysticks with 10 bit ADC MCP3008
* PAM8403 amplifier, mono speaker and stereo headphones
* NRF24L01 radio without PA+LNA
# Kits
There aren't any kits at the moment, and probably there won't be any. You'll need to buy everything by yourself - please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/Leoneq/iNapMalinka/wiki).
# Updates
I'm going to update the project as needed, although more significant changes will go to Malinka v2 - stay tuned. You can follow me on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/leoneq112) for small updates on the project.  
You can also consider supporting me on my [kofi page](https://ko-fi.com/leoneq)!

# UPCOMING CHANGES FOR THE NEW VERSION:  
* add test pads  
* change layout so touch connector is in place  
* change cutout so triggers can be printed w/o supports  
* change power switch to smd one, and re-route battery charger
* move to eagle instead of easyeda
* change normal nrf to version with pa+lna
* add a soundcard via i2s (?)
* make layout symmetric (?)
* instead of using cutout, make a huge pad for screen cable
* move the pi so it doesn't need to be cut
* remodel buttons as needed (guides, holes, flat shape)
* test parallel connection
* stereo sound output
* speaker enclosures 
* usb c charging + differential route thing
* consider cm4 instead of zero2w
* make a border in the case for matching
* make decent, two part holes
* if you have more ideas, contact me!

Again, I strongly recommend to wait for the new board version. In the current one not everything works.
